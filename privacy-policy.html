    <p><strong>SunkenPeak</strong> respects your privacy. This policy explains how <strong>Follow Through</strong> handles your information.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection</h2>
    <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information, such as your name, email address, or contact details. We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking SDKs.</p>

    <h2>2. On-Device Processing</h2>
    <p>All video analysis and rally detection are performed <strong>locally</strong> on your device's hardware. Your videos never leave your device and are never transmitted to SunkenPeak or any third party.</p>

    <h2>3. iCloud & CloudKit</h2>
    <p>The App uses Apple’s CloudKit to sync your credit balance and notes across your devices. This data is stored in your private iCloud container. SunkenPeak has no access to this data.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is safe for users of all ages as it does not collect personal data or require account creation.</p>

    <h2>5. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>You can delete your synced data at any time through your iCloud settings. Since we do not store your data on our own servers, we cannot delete it for you.</p>
